sdl-hercules (4.3~dev20200821-1ppa1~ubuntu18.04) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Build an updated package version off commit 03d08aeb of the upstream
    development branch.  This picks up numerous improvements made since the
    4.2.1 release, including fixes for bugs that were causing IPL errors
    with certain guest operating systems.

sdl-hercules (4.2.1-1ppa3~ubuntu18.04) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Use post-install script to configure `hercifc` so members of the
    "hercules" group to execute it as (setuid) root.  This allows such users
    to operate guest (emulated) systems with TCP/IP networking without having
    to run Hercules as root.

sdl-hercules (4.2.1-1ppa2~ubuntu18.04) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Add "libregina3" as a recommended dependency to suppress warnings about
    missing libraries at start up.  Not declaring libregina3 as a required
    dependency since it does not seem to be needed for basic functionality.
    (Closes: #1)
  * Add "Provides: hercules" so this package can be used as a drop-in
    replacement for the original "hercules" package; helpful for those
    wanting to use Hercules Studio as a GUI front-end.

sdl-hercules (4.2.1-1ppa3~ubuntu18.04) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Use post-install script to configure `hercifc` so members of the
    "hercules" group to execute it as (setuid) root.  This allows such users
    to operate guest (emulated) systems with TCP/IP networking without having
    to run Hercules as root.

sdl-hercules (4.2.1-1ppa2~ubuntu18.04) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Add "libregina3" as a recommended dependency to suppress warnings about
    missing libraries at start up.  Not declaring libregina3 as a required
    dependency since it does not seem to be needed for basic functionality.
    (Closes: #1)
  * Add "Provides: hercules" so this package can be used as a drop-in
    replacement for the original "hercules" package; helpful for those
    wanting to use Hercules Studio as a GUI front-end.
